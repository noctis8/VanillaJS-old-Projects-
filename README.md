# VanillaJS-old-Projects
These are small vanilla JavaScript applications I built back in 2024 when I was first learning the language. 


## 📁 Projects

- 🔵 [reaction_speed_test](./reaction_speed_test/testReactionSpeed.html)  
A simple app that tests your reaction speed — you need to click when the green light turns on.

- 🧮 [memory_game](./memory_game/memoryGame.html)  
A classic memory matching game, no explanation needed.


## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)


## 📌 Note

These were some of my first JS projects — they helped me understand the fundamentals. I'm keeping them here as a reference and personal archive.
